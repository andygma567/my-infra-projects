# Both references are needed. The first is a directory where the group files are stored.
# The second is the actual hosts file. This allows using multiple inventory sources,
# e.g. a static file and a dynamic inventory script It would also work to just have the
# single file: inventory = ./inventory/hosts.yaml and symlink or copy the generated
# hosts.yml to that location. symlinks behave differently for relative vs absolute
# paths, so test with `ansible-inventory --graph` to ensure it works
